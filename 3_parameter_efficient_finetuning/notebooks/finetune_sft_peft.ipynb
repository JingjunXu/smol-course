        "This notebook demonstrates how to efficiently fine-tune large language models using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adapters. LoRA is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique that:\n",
        "- Freezes the pre-trained model weights\n",
        "- Adds small trainable rank decomposition matrices to attention layers\n",
        "- Typically reduces trainable parameters by ~90%\n",
        "- Maintains model performance while being memory efficient\n",

        "2. Create and prepare the dataset for adapter training\n",
